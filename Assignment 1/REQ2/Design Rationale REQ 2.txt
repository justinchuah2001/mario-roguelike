REQ 2 

New class, JumpAction:

The JumpAction class will extend from the abstract class Actions. The plan is that if Player wants to move to a high ground, wall or tree,
it will generate a random number and based on requirement specifications, decide if the player will move to said high ground by calling 
MoveActorAction() or fail, deduct the playerâ€™s health points and call DoNothingAction() instead.
